# Something-out-of-necessity
Just an example for saving some content from websites in case your internet is crappy and you need access later.

Its just some website you can host on your machine. Give it some links and it wil get the contetn for you for later viewing.

What to do: (for non tech people)

Download a server for hosting the files (your local website)</br>
Popular window server "XAMPP" </br>
1 - <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">Download server software ( around 100MB)</a></br>
2 - open .exe file and go through the wizard</br>
3 - Go to the base directory of the install, probably something like C:\xampp\</br>
</br>

How is this slamed togheter?</br>
- <a href="http://themes.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap for some layout</a></br>
- <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html">libarary; html to pdf</a></br>

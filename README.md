# Something-out-of-necessity
Just an example for saving some content from websites in case your internet is crappy and you need access later.

Its just some website you can host on your machine. Give it some links and it wil get the contetn for you for later viewing.

What to do: (for non tech people)

Download a server for hosting the files (your local website)</br>
Popular window server "Wampserver" 
1 - <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">Download server software</a>
2 - open .exe file and go through the wizard
  2.5 Having some dll error? look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xz-lLj3Dkg 
3 - Go to the base directory of the install, probably something like C:\wamp\
